# Word Guess Game

A simple terminal-based word guessing game built with Python.

## Description

This game randomly selects a word from a predefined list of fruits. The player has to guess the word **one letter at a time** within a limited number of attempts.

Each correct guess reveals the letter in its correct position, while each wrong guess reduces the number of remaining attempts. The game ends when:
- The word is completely guessed (**you win!**), or
- You run out of attempts (**game over**).

## Instructions

1. Run the script in your terminal.
2. You will see blanks representing the hidden word.
3. Guess one letter at a time.
4. The game will show:
   - Correct guesses filled in the word.
   - Remaining attempts after a wrong guess.
